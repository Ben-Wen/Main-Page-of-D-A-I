[00:01.53]Sitting Down Here (Original Version) - Lene Marlin
[00:01.82]I'm sitting down here
[00:03.60]But hey you can't see me
[00:05.75]
[00:25.08]Your words cut rather deeply
[00:27.01]They're just some other lies
[00:28.32]
[00:28.89]I'm hiding from a distance
[00:30.72]I've got to pay the price
[00:32.67]Defending all against it
[00:34.50]I really don't know why
[00:36.01]
[00:36.55]You're obsessed with all my secrets
[00:38.42]You always make me cry
[00:39.84]
[00:40.44]You seem to wanna hurt me
[00:42.27]No matter what I do
[00:43.68]
[00:44.26]I'm telling just a couple
[00:46.16]But somehow it gets to you
[00:48.06]But I've learned how to get revenge
[00:50.24]And I swear you'll experience that some day
[00:52.26]
[00:56.01]I'm sitting down here
[00:57.48]But hey you can't see me kinda invisible 
[01:01.74]You don't sense my stay
[01:03.75]Not really hiding not like a shadow
[01:06.97]
[01:07.53]Just thought I would join you for one day
